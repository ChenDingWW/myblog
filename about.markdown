My name is Chen Ding. I'm from China. Now I'm located in London. I studied Journalism and English in undergraduate, but I found out that I'm more into cultural studies. So I chose as many cultural modules as I could, which include many cultural expressions such as literature, art, history, photography, etc.

I was on an exchange programme at University of Westminster in 2018, and one of the module I had is Modern Art in London. I was able to visit many brilliant museums and galleries because of the module. My favourite exhibition was Knock Knock: Humour in Contemporary Art at South London Gallery. It's a past exhibition but you can still view some pictures on their website, and I also have some picture here. I really like the sense it conveyed, a bit creepy yet humorous right?

I'm also a big fan of theatre. For those who are also into theatre, you might want to check out the NT Shakespeare app. It's a comprehensive theatre archive developed by National Theatre, including pictures, videos and other documentation of all the Shakespeare productions they've made.
