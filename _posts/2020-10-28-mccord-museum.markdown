For the McCord Museum, I mainly focused on its online collection section, which is built separately from the museum website as a database. The database has a search function which supports keywords search and advanced search. The collections are divided into 6 parts, including:
- [Documentary Art](http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/en/search/collection/00017)
- [Dress, Fashion and Textiles](http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/en/search/collection/00013)
- [Indigenous Cultures](http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/en/search/collection/00015)
- [Material Culture](http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/en/search/collection/00014)
- [Photography](http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/en/search/collection/00016)
- [Archives](http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/en/search/collection/00018)

Out of nearly 1,500,000 artefacts, 128,815 objects are accessble online. The obljects are presented in images with high resolution. However, I feel limited when I was trying to look at the details of some artefacts, for example, this [wedding dress](http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/M2001.76.1.1-3), because there is only one image of the dress and I couldn't observe it from different angles. I think I might try to use 3D model to present the artefacts when building my cultural website. [Autodesk Recap Photo](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/recap/overview?plc=RECAP&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1) is a tool for photogrammetry 3D scanning which I learned from another module.

The database also provides several explore options including **collections**, **artists**, **objects**, **time periods**, **geocultural areas**, **geocultural map**, **thematic resources** and **fonds**.

The database uses games and thematic tours to increase engagement. I think some new technologies like AR and VR (can't say they are new to be honest) can be used when building a website. There are tools such as [Metaverse](https://studio.gometa.io/discover/me) to creat AR experiences.
