Things from Google Arts & Culture I find special:
- It develops a lot of ways to build interaction with visitors, for example, [art selfie](https://artsandculture.google.com/camera/selfie), [game](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/what-came-first/ZQGBUPErEE3bVg), and [artwork transformer](https://artsandculture.google.com/camera/art-transfer), to make visitors get involved. It also provides much fun for the exploration.
- It has a well-built mobile app which visitors can access using their phones anywhere and at anytime.
- It has high-resolution images and videos of artworks for visitors to look into.

It is very hard to get contents organised and put into categories when there are so many partner institutions thoughout the world. What Google Arts & Culture does is giving visitors different choices to explore the collections in the way they like.

Visitors can go straight into the highlights section if they want to have a quick look at the museums and galleries. They can also go by categories such as [artists](https://artsandculture.google.com/category/artist), [mediums](https://artsandculture.google.com/category/medium), and [art movements](https://artsandculture.google.com/category/art-movement), or go by topics such as [expressionism](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/expressionism/m0pybl?categoryid=art-movement), [watercolour painting](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/watercolor-painting/m018ktp?categoryid=medium). Collections can also be explored by [time](https://artsandculture.google.com/time?date=2000) and [colour](https://artsandculture.google.com/color?col=GREEN), which I think is a great narrative, especially for online display. Last but not least, there is a [list](https://artsandculture.google.com/partner) of all the museums and galleries on the bottom so that visitors can go from one to another.

In a nut shell, what I took from Google Arts & Culture is its various **interactive experience** and its **flexible exploration options**.
